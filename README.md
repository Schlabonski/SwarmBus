# SwarmBus
This is a simple project that can get arbitrarly complicated. The swarmtransport module is supposed to simulate and visualize a swarm of busses that drives around, changes color according to its position, choose and pick up passengers and bring them to their destination.

For an impression of random busses driving around on a vispy canvas, have a look at the `random_bus.py` example (which should be moved to an example directory, btw...).
